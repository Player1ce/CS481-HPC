# Conway's Game of Life
This repository contains multiple implementations of Conway's game of life developed for the CS 481 High Performance Computing course. Each version (homework submission) is stored as a standalone module in its respective folder. Additionally, a combination of the files can be found in the `src` folder and utility files can be found in the `util` folder 

## Homework 1: Basic Implementation
The first assigned homework simply asked for any implementation of Conway's game of life as a baseline. I implemented it using a threadpool and a dedicated class for board tracking. Unfortunately, this version underperformed, doing worse than the teacher's single threaded implementation
Source code: `homework1Submission`

## Homework 2: Multithread Version 


# Homework 3

- The files for homework 3 are stored in the `homework3Submission/` directory.
- Output files for homework3 are stored in `homework3Submission/test-results/`
- Build instructions are at the top of `homework3Submission/GameOfLifeStandalone.cpp`
